# z21-drive
Java library for driving model trains with Fleischmann/Roco z21 DCC centre. 
Meant as a lightweight, but less functional alternative to JMRI, because there will be only driving functionallity. One can easily implement other stuff if he wants. Supports loco addresses up to 127.

In the current state it doesn't support some minor part of z21 network protocol. If you get information on unsupported features create a new issue.

Made for a real life control cab, but can also be used for automation if you implement LocoNet stuff.

Feel free to fork and make pull requests.
