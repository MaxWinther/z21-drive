# z21-drive
Java library for driving model trains with Fleischmann/Roco z21 DCC centre. 
Meant as a lightweight, but less functional alternative to JMRI, because there will be only driving functionallity. One can easily implement other stuff tho.
Supports loco addresses up to 63.

NOT YET FINISHED!!!
